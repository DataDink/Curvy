# Curvy JS
An experimental micro MVVM framework based on AngularJS

Curious about Curvy?

It's pretty small and simple. 
I made it for the fun of making. 
There is SOME small amount of documentation available at https://github.com/datadink/curvy

If you want to toy with it or use it in something feel free.
If you would like something changed send me a pull request.


-- Cheers!
