<h3>Application</h3>
<p>
   If you're curious about Curvy and just getting started you will probably want to know
   a little bit about how it is structured.
</p>
<p>
   Curvy, by itself, is a host for modules and services that come together to form an application.
   Calling the <em>Curvy.create()</em> method will create a new instance of Curvy and attach itself
   to your page.
</p>
<p>
   Like Angular you can pre-load any services, bindings, and viewmodels required to run your
   application. With Curvy, however, you can also load up additional functionality at any time.
</p>
<h3>Pre-Configuration</h3>
<p>
   Your application will likely be comprised of a number of
   <strong>services</strong>, <strong>custom bindings</strong>, and <strong>view-models</strong>.
   These can all be configured directly from the <em>register</em> function on the
   Curvy constructor.
</p>
<p class="container-fluid">
   <strong class="col-sm-3">Constructors</strong>
   <span class="col-sm-9">
      Constructors in Curvy are similar to Angular. The class constructor function is wrapped in an array and preceeded with
      the names of the dependencies required to construct the service. I have chosen to not read the parameter names of the
      class constructor function since these names will be destroyed during processes like minification.
   </span><br />
</p>
<p class="container-fluid">
   <strong class="col-sm-3">Services</strong>
   <span class="col-sm-9">
      <strong>Curvy.register.service(name, constructor)</strong><br />
      Provides a method to add custom services to your application. Registration of services
      are singleton dependencies which are created only once and recycled each time
      they are needed.
   </span>
</p>
<p class="container-fluid">
   <strong class="col-sm-3">Bindings</strong>
   <span class="col-sm-9">
      <strong>Curvy.register.binding(attributeName, constructor)</strong><br />
      Provides a method to add custom bindings to your application. Registration of bindings
      is similar to transient dependencies in that they are newly created each time they are needed,
      but bindings can't be asked for as dependencies. Bindings are registered by their attribute
      name and will only be triggered with a matching attribute in the DOM.
   </span>
</p>
<p class="container-fluid">
   <strong class="col-sm-3">View Models</strong>
   <span class="col-sm-9">
      <strong>Curvy.register.viewmodel(name, constructor)</strong><br />
      Provides a method to register view models for your application. Registration of view models
      is similar to transient dependencies, but like bindings can't be asked for as dependencies.
      View models can only be triggered when a "view-model" attribute is added to the DOM
      with a value matching the registered name.
   </span>
</p>
<p class="container-fluid">
   <strong class="col-sm-3">Dependencies</strong>
   <span class="col-sm-9">
      <strong>Curvy.register.instance(name, object)</strong><br />
      Registers a pre-constructed object as a named dependency.
   </span><br />
</p>
<div>
   <p class="col-sm-9 col-sm-offset-3">
   </p>

   <p class="col-sm-9 col-sm-offset-3">
      <strong>Curvy.register.singleton(name, constructor)</strong><br />
      Registers an injection constructor as a named dependency.
      This will not be constructed until it is needed for the first time as a dependency
      in the application. Singleton dependencies are constructed
      once per application and re-used for all other dependency requirements.
   </p>

   <p class="col-sm-9 col-sm-offset-3">
      <strong>Curvy.register.contextual(name, constructor)</strong><br />
      Registers an injection constructor as a named dependency.
      This will not be constructed until it is needed for the first time as a dependency
      in the application. Contextual dependencies are constructed once per resolution scope
      and re-used for all descendant dependency requirements.
   </p>

   <p class="col-sm-9 col-sm-offset-3">
      <strong>Curvy.register.transient(name, constructor)</strong><br />
      Registers an injection constructor as a named dependency.
      This will not be constructed until it is needed for the first time as a dependency
      in the application. Transient dependencies are always
      re-constructed every time they are required as a dependency.
   </p>
</div>
<h3>Post-Configuration</h3>
<p>
   After the application has been instantiated it is still possible for additional dependencies and
   view models to be added to your application "on the fly".
</p>
<p class="container-fluid">
   <strong class="col-sm-3">Dependencies</strong>
   <span class="col-sm-9">
      The constructed application <em>(Curvy.create())</em> provides instance, singleton, contextual,
      and transient functions for late registration of dependencies.
   </span>
</p>
<div>
   <p class="col-sm-9 col-sm-offset-3">
      <strong>.dependencies.register.instance(name, object)</strong><br />
      registers a pre-constructed object as a named dependency.
   </p>

   <p class="col-sm-9 col-sm-offset-3">
      <strong>.register.singleton(name, constructor)</strong><br />
      Registers an injection constructor as a named dependency.
      This will not be constructed until it is needed for the first time as a dependency
      in the application. Singleton dependencies are constructed
      once per application and re-used for all other dependency requirements.

   <p class="col-sm-9 col-sm-offset-3">
      <strong>.register.contextual(name, constructor)</strong><br />
      Registers an injection constructor as a named dependency.
      This will not be constructed until it is needed for the first time as a dependency
      in the application. Contextual dependencies are constructed once per resolution scope
      and re-used for all descendant dependency requirements.
   </p>

   <p class="col-sm-9 col-sm-offset-3">
      <strong>.register.transient(name, constructor)</strong><br />
      Registers an injection constructor as a named dependency.
      This will not be constructed until it is needed for the first time as a dependency
      in the application. Transient dependencies are always
      re-constructed every time they are required as a dependency.

<p class="container-fluid">
   <strong class="col-sm-3">View Models</strong>
   <span class="col-sm-9">
      <strong>.viewmodel(name, constructor)</strong><br />
