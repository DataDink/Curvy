<h3>Bindings</h3>
<p>
   Bindings connect the DOM to your code. As elements are added and removed
   from the root element of your document they will be scanned by the framework
   and bound appropriately based on their attributes and location in the document.
</p>
<p>
   New or custom bindings should be added before app creation directly on the Curvy
   constructor's "Curvy.register.binding(name, constructor)" function.
</p>
<pre>
&lt;div my-binding="pew pew"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>
<pre>
Curvy.register.binding('my-binding', [function() {
   console.log(this.element.getAttribute('my-binding'));
}]);
</pre>
<p class="container-fluid">
   <em class="col-sm-3">this.element</em>
   <span class="col-sm-9">
      The DOM Element the binding was located on.
   </span>
</p>
<p class="container-fluid">
   <em class="col-sm-3">this.suspend()</em>
   <span class="col-sm-9">
      The suspend function on a binding will halt further binding on the current element and
      its decendants. This returns a "resume" function that when called will attempt to
      re-bind the suspended element and its decendants.
   </span>
</p>
<p class="container-fluid">
   <em class="col-sm-3">this.register(name, value)</em>
   <span class="col-sm-9">
      The register function on a binding will override dependency requests with the specified
      value for this binding and its decendants. Any future binding on this element and its
      decendants will receive this value instead of any service previously registered to
      the specified name.
   </span>
</p>
<p class="container-fluid">
   <em class="col-sm-3">this.dispose(function)</em>
   <span class="col-sm-9">
      Registers a function that will be called when the binding's element is removed from
      the document. This should be used to clean up resources referenced by your code that
      might cause memory leaks in single-page applications.
   </span>
